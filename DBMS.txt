                                                                                                --------
Database
------------
-> A database is a collection of data, typically describing the activities of one or more related organizations. 
-> For example, a university database might contain information about the following:
	- Entities such as students, faculty, courses, and classrooms.
	- Relationships between entities, such as students’ enrollment in courses, faculty teaching courses,
	  and the use of rooms for courses.


DBMS
--------
-> Database Mangement System (DBMS) is a software that is designed to assist in maintaining and utilizing
    large collections of data efficiently.
->The first general purpose DBMS was designed by Charles Bachman in 1960s which was also called as 
    Integral data model.
-> In 1960s, IBM developed the Information Management System(IMS) DBMS which was also called as 
    hierarchial data model.
-> In 1970, Edgar Codd, at IBM proposed a new model called as relational data model.
->  The SQL query language for relational databases, developed as part of IBM’s System R project, is now the 
     standard query language. SQL was standardized in the late 1980s, and the current standard,  SQL-92, was 
     adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Standards Organization (ISO).


Advantages of DBMS
---------------------------
-> Data Indepndence
-> Efficient data access
-> Data integrity and security
-> Data administration
-> Concurrent access and data recovery


Data Model
---------------
-> A data model is a collection of high-level data description constructs that hide many low-level storage details. 
-> A DBMS allows a user to define the data to be stored in terms of a data model.
-> Most database management systems today are based on the relational data model.


The Relational Data Model
----------------------------------
A description of data in terms of a data model is called a schema. In the relational model, the schema 
for a relation specifies its name, the name of each field (or attribute or column), and the type of each field.

Ex : Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer, cgpa: real)


Entity
-------
-> An entity is an object in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects.
-> A collection of similar entities is called as entity set.
-> A relationship is an association among two or more entities.


Key Points
--------------
-> Database design has six steps: requirements analysis, conceptual database design, logical database design, 
    schema refinement, physical database design, and security design.

-> In the ER model, a real-world object is represented as an entity. 
-> An entity set is a collection of structurally identical entities. 
-> Entities are described using attributes.
-> Each entity set has a distinguished set of attributes called a key that can be used to uniquely identify each entity.

-> A relationship is an association between two or more entities.
-> A relationship set is a collection of relationships that relate entities from the same entity sets. 
-> A relationship can also have descriptive attributes.


Relational Models
-----------------------
-> An instance of a relation is a set of tuples, also called records, in which each tuple has the same number of fields 
    as the relation schema. 
-> A relation instance can be thought of as a table in which each tuple is a row, and all rows 
    have the same number of fields.
